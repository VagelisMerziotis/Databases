In this folder I present a very simple use of the psycopg2 library to create a postgres database as well as populate the 
database with table sand the tables with entries.

Note that the this little standalone project only serves to demonstrate the ease of use of Python libraries to access, manipulate and store data.

The most challenging part was the mapping of the foreign keys after populating the individual tables and before inserting
data into the main table.

Dataset was acquired from a public Kaggle competition on used cars.
